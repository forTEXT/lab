abstract: We approach the modeling of event structure of literary texts with narratological
  event concepts. A manually annotated corpus of 4 prose texts with event categories
  allows us to learn to automatically classify events using a transformer model, relying
  on a rule-based system in conjunction with a pretrained parser to identify events.
  For the evaluation of both manual and automated annotation, we use narrativity graphs,
  which capture the change in narrativity over the course of the text. In an exploratory
  analysis, we apply the event classifier in conjunction with graph-based narrativity
  metrics to a large literary corpus. We find that text length does neither influence
  the length of eventful passages nor the number of eventful passages in the beginnings
  of texts.
