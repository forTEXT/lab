abstract: Topic modelling is considered a statistical tool for the thematic decomposition
  of texts. In reality, it captures only statistical patterns in the structure of
  the object. This sensitivity of the method for structure makes it less effective
  when applied to literary texts in which structure itself is a relevant feature with
  an artistic function. In this paper, we calculate a series of topic models for three
  corpora of literary narratives with various stages of data cleaning. We apply coherence
  values, qualitative interpretation and measurement of topic distances in order to
  shed some light on the regularities between text features and the quality of the
  topic modelling performed for literary prose.
