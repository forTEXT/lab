abstract: In this contribution we discuss what we call the “digital humanities-as-structuralism”
  narrative for the case of computational literary studies. To better understand the
  entailed criticism, we start with some background for the non-computational aspects
  in this narrative. First, we single out major criticisms against structuralism.
  We then introduce a general and theory-independent model of literary text analysis
  and discuss hypothesis development and justification in literary studies. This builds
  the ground for our analysis of structuralism criticisms in computational literary
  studies. In our discussion of the “digital humanities-as-structuralism” narrative,
  we examine the use of computational methods for the exploration and confirmation
  of interpretation hypotheses and its potential relation to structuralist issues.
  We argue that the “digital humanities-as-structuralism” narrative may be productive
  where it cautions against reductionist approaches, but it is not appropriate for
  describing exploratory or partial approaches and the presentation of their findings.
  There, the computational approaches should rather be seen as enabling connectivity
  and fostering the joint endeavor of understanding.
