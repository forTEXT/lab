CATMA (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis) is an open source and free to use web application that supports the annotation and analysis of digitized texts. In continual development since 2008, CATMA is widely used by a diverse audience, especially in the Digital Humanities. Its primary features are manual annotation, a flexible system for the development of annotation categories, a built-in query language to explore texts and associated data, as well as interactive visualizations. Perhaps most importantly, CATMA data is easily accessible and exportable, so that it can be further processed using other tools and methods.
