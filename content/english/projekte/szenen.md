“Szenen” was a joint research project with  the Universities of Würzburg and Cologne, which targets the automatic  detection of scenes in narrative texts. Based on our definition of scenes (Gius et al. 2019), we formulated annotation guidelines and conducted a manual scene annotation of several narrative texts of high and trivial literature. In addition, we organized a Shared Task on scene recognition in 2021, where participants were asked to develop a model for automated scene segmentation.
