abstract: 'Automatizing the process of understanding the global narrative structure
  of long texts and stories is still a major challenge for state-of-the-art natural
  language understanding systems, particularly because annotated data is scarce and
  existing annotation workflows do not scale well to the annotation of complex narrative
  phenomena. In this work, we focus on the identification of narrative levels in texts
  corresponding to stories that are embedded in stories. Lacking sufficient pre-annotated
  training data, we explore a solution to deal with data scarcity that is common in
  machine learning: the automatic augmentation of an existing small data set of annotated
  samples with the help of data synthesis. We present a workflow for narrative level
  detection, that includes the operationalization of the task, a model, and a data
  augmentation protocol for automatically generating narrative texts annotated with
  breaks between narrative levels. Our experiments suggest that narrative levels in
  long text constitute a challenging phenomenon for state-of-the-art NLP models, but
  generating training data synthetically does improve the prediction results considerably.'
