abstract: This article describes the methodology and the outcomes of an empirical
  study of conflict narratives. The narratological analysis deployed narratological
  catego足ries in the structuralist tradition based on Genette and was conducted with
  the help of the text annotation tool CATMA. The analysis aimed at covering as many
  narratological phenomena as possible by establishing 14 fields of narrato足logical
  phenomena that were annotated in a corpus of 39 factual narratives about situations
  at the workplace with and without conflicts. The evaluation of approximately 28,000
  annotations brought to light a series of interrelations be足tween narratological
  phenomena and the presence or absence of conflicts in the narratives. Additionally,
  this approach led to the identification of some over足sights of narrative theory
  by detecting hitherto unnoticed interrelations among narratological concepts.
