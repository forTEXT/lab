#### PLANS

PLANS ("Unitizing Plot to Advance Analysis of Narrative Structure") is a follow-up project of EvENT ("Evaluating Events in Narrative Theory"), focusing on the exploration and design of plot concepts in narrative theory. Based on linguistic and narratological approaches, we are modeling units of action that enable the exploration of narrative structures and the construction of texts.
