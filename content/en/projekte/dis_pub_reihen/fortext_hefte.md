#### forTEXT Hefte

By introducing the forTEXT editions (forTEXT Hefte), we aim to offer thematically grouped content from our website (fortext.net) and provide it as an open access journal. This will include method descriptions, course units, teaching modules, and tool descriptions. In addition, forTEXT editions will serve as a platform for other researchers to publish their content on DH methods, resources, and tools.
