#### Konflikte

In literary studies, the concept of conflict is used in a variety of contexts. These include the analysis of conflicts between characters, the study of how epochs deal with societal conflicts, and the exploration of poetological concerns. In the fortext lab, we focus on (1) the operationalization of conflict types using a category-theoretical approach and (2)  heuristics for measuring conflict e.g. through adapted methods of word embedding-based sentiment analysis.
