#### forTEXT Hefte
By introducing the forTEXT editions (forTEXT Hefte), we offer thematically grouped content from our website (fortext.net) and provide it as an open access journal. This includes method descriptions, course units, teaching modules, and tool descriptions. In addition, the aim is for forTEXT editions to serve as a platform for other researchers to publish their content on DH methods, resources, and tools.
