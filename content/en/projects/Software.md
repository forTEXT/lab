    Link="https://catma.de"
    Description="CATMA (Computer Assisted Text Markup and Analysis) is a free to use, open source web application that supports the annotation and analysis of digitized texts. Its primary features are manual annotation, a flexible system for the development of annotation categories, a built-in query language to analyze texts and metadata, as well as interactive visualizations. CATMA data is easily accessible and exportable, which makes it particularly suitable for further processing with other tools and methods.  In continual development since 2008, CATMA is widely used by a diverse audience, especially in the Digital Humanities." >}}

#### GitMA
GitMA is a Python package that you can use to process, analyze and manipulate CATMA annotations via the Git Access.
