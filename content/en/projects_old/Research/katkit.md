#### KatKit

The aim of KatKit (KATegories toolKIT) is to support humanities thinking through mathematically grounded methods in order to reduce the risk of unintended inconsistencies and inconsistent models, and to facilitate the operationalization of humanities concepts.  
For the toolkit, methods of applied category theory are adapted and further developed for use in the digital humanities. The interdisciplinary approach pursued here combines thinking in the humanities, computer science and philosophy of science, whose common points of contact are structures and patterns that can be described in category theory. Ultimately, the aim is to integrate the results into existing tool chains and workflows of the Digital Humanities and to be able to use them with existing software (e.g. the annotation software CATMA).
