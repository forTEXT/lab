#### Event

In EvENT ("Evaluating Events in Narrative Theory") we are developing, in cooperation with the Language Technology Group at the University of Hamburg (Prof. Dr. Chris Biemann), an approach for formalizing and analyzing events and eventfulness in narratives. The approach is based on natural language processing (NLP) and narratological concepts from literary studies.
